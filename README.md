## Experimental Ergogen GUI by Cache
See the demo at [https://mveerd.github.io/ergogen-gui/](https://mveerd.github.io/ergogen-gui/)

This is a recreation of the [Ergogen](https://github.com/mrzealot/ergogen) WebUI by @MrZealot in React / Typescript.  

It's currently still compatible with the original build through some global scoped dependencies.


### Usage 

#### `yarn install` - installs dependencies

#### `yarn start` - starts a development server at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
